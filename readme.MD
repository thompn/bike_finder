#Bike Finder

A simple web crawler that looks at motos.coches.net and:

1) Searches for motorcycles held in the preferences, these preferences can hold as many bikes as needed, with budget, mileage, location and model restrictions.

2) Writes all finds to a database on the backend to keep track of bikes found.

3) Sends a message about the bike to a specified telegram chat using the telepot wrapper for the Telegram bot API.
